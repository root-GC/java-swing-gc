An object called a layout manager determines how controls are arranged in a
frame. Some of the layout managers and their characteristics are:
FlowLayout Places controls in successive rows, fitting as
many as possible in a given row.
BorderLayout Places controls against any of the four frame
borders.
CardLayout Places controls on top of each other like a deck of
cards.
GridLayout Places controls within a specified rectangular
grid.
GridBagLayout Places controls with a specified very flexible
rectangular grid.
BoxLayout Arranges controls either in a row or column.
SpringLayout Arranges controls with positions defined by
sprints and struts.
